# Car-Purchase-Amount-Prediction-using-ANN

Overview
This project implements a Car Price Prediction Model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in a Jupyter Notebook. The model predicts car prices based on demographic and financial features such as Gender, Age, Net Worth, Credit Card Debt, and Annual Salary. The project demonstrates the use of deep learning for regression tasks and emphasizes the importance of feature engineering and neural network design in predictive modeling.

Features
The model uses the following features to predict car prices:

Gender: Categorical feature indicating the individual's gender (e.g., Male, Female).
Age: Numerical feature representing the age of the individual.
Net Worth: Numerical feature indicating the individual's total assets minus liabilities.
Credit Card Debt: Numerical feature representing the individual's total credit card debt.
Annual Salary: Numerical feature indicating the individual's yearly income.
The target variable is the Car Price, a continuous numerical value.
